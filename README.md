## 1. Who Is Our User, Really?

**This is the most important question. Our answer is specific — not "gig workers in India."**

Our user is **Arjun**. He is 26 years old. He rides a **bicycle** for **Blinkit** in the **Rohini zone of Delhi**. He completes **28–32 trips per day**, each taking 8–10 minutes, each paying **₹35–₹42**. His total daily income is **₹1,050–₹1,340**.

He is not a food delivery rider. He is not an Amazon driver. He is a **quick-commerce cyclist** — and that distinction changes everything about what a useful insurance product looks like.

### Why the distinction matters

| Attribute | Arjun (Q-Commerce, Blinkit) | A Swiggy food rider |
|---|---|---|
| Delivery radius | **1.5–2 km from dark store** | 5–10 km from restaurant |
| Trips per day | **28–32 trips** | 8–15 trips |
| Time per trip | **8–10 minutes** | 25–45 minutes |
| Vehicle | **Bicycle** | Motorcycle |
| Heavy rain impact | **Immediate zero income** — can't complete 10-min SLA | Slows down, still earns |
| AQI 450+ impact | **Platform cuts zone assignments 60%** — income collapses | Continues with mask |
| Flood impact | **Zone physically unreachable** — dark store goes dark | Reroutes |

> **The critical insight:** Arjun's income loss is not gradual. It is **binary**. When Delhi AQI hits 450, Blinkit reduces order density by 60–70% in affected zones. Arjun's income doesn't drop from ₹1,200 to ₹800. It drops from ₹1,200 to **₹280**. That is not a bad day. That is a rent crisis.

### Why every existing product fails Arjun

1. **No payslip.** Blinkit pays per-trip via UPI. No salary, no Form 16, no employer letter — all of which traditional income-loss insurance requires.
2. **Speed mismatch.** Arjun's rent is due on the 1st. A 45-day claims process is not a slow solution — it is no solution.
3. **Weekly income, weekly expenses.** Arjun earns ~₹8,000/week and spends ~₹7,500/week. No weekly income-loss insurance product exists in India.
4. **The category does not exist.** No Indian insurer — HDFC ERGO, Bajaj Allianz, New India Assurance, or any InsurTech — offers environmental income-loss coverage for platform gig workers.

### Our user is not just Arjun. He is 3.5 lakh riders.

| City | Primary Disruption | Est. Active Riders | Annual Disruption Days |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delhi NCR | AQI crisis + extreme heat | ~80,000 | 60–80 days |
| Mumbai | Monsoon flooding + cyclones | ~55,000 | 30–50 days |
| Bengaluru | Waterlogging + storms | ~45,000 | 20–35 days |
| Hyderabad | Heatwaves + flash floods | ~30,000 | 30–45 days |
| Pune | Heavy monsoon rain | ~25,000 | 25–40 days |
| Kolkata | Cyclone proximity + flooding | ~20,000 | 35–50 days |

## 2. The Problem — With Real Numbers

| Disruption | Daily Loss | Frequency (Delhi) | Annual Loss |
|---|---|---|---|
| AQI > 300 (60% assignment reduction) | ₹700–₹900 | 35–45 days | ₹24,500–₹40,500 |
| Heavy rain > 35mm (zone waterlogged) | ₹600–₹900 | 20–30 days | ₹12,000–₹27,000 |
| Extreme heat > 43°C | ₹400–₹700 | 25–35 days | ₹10,000–₹24,500 |
| Flash flood / drainage failure | ₹800–₹1,100 | 8–12 days | ₹6,400–₹13,200 |
| City bandh / curfew | ₹1,000–₹1,200 | 3–6 days | ₹3,000–₹7,200 |

**Total estimated annual income loss: ₹35,000–₹60,000 per rider** — 20–30% of total annual income, lost to uncontrollable events, with zero compensation mechanism in existence today.

**Market opportunity:** 3.5 lakh riders × ₹60/week × 52 weeks = **₹109 crore annual premium pool** from Phase 1 cities alone. At 65% loss ratio (IRDAI parametric sandbox standard), financially viable from the first 1,000 riders.

---

## 3. What We Built — Parametric Insurance

**Parametric insurance** pays a fixed amount when a measurable external event crosses a pre-agreed threshold — with no claims, no paperwork, no investigation.

```
Traditional Insurance:
Event → Claim Filed → Documentation → Investigation → Assessment → Settlement (30–90 days)

KavachAI Parametric:
Event → Threshold Breached → External API Confirms → 5-Layer Fraud Check → Payout (< 30 min)
```

This model is proven at scale: PMFBY weather-indexed crop insurance (5+ crore farmers), AXA flight delay insurance (auto-triggers on 3-hour delay), Swiss Re Caribbean Catastrophe Insurance (wind speed trigger). KavachAI is the **first parametric income protection product for Q-Commerce workers in India**, calibrated to dark store zone level (2 km radius) — not district or city level.

### The KavachAI promise to Arjun

When Delhi AQI hits 450 and sustains for 4 hours:
- Arjun does **nothing**.
- The Trigger Engine detects the breach via CPCB/OpenWeatherMap APIs.
- The 5-layer fraud check runs in under 60 seconds.
- ₹350–₹500 is initiated via Razorpay simulation.
- Firebase FCM pushes: *"Disruption in your zone. ₹350 credited."*
- No claim filed. No document uploaded. No call made.

---

## 4. How Our AI Actually Works

KavachAI has three AI components and **11 ML models loaded and serving in production**. Each component is described with algorithm rationale, exact input features, output specification, and honest Phase 2 vs Phase 3 status.

---

### AI Component 1: Dynamic Premium Pricing Engine

**Problem it solves:** A flat multiplier formula gives the same premium to every Rohini rider regardless of trip frequency, vehicle type, or zone micro-risk. The ML ensemble produces a fairer, actuarially accurate premium.

**Algorithm:** XGBoost + LightGBM meta-learner ensemble (60/40 weighted blend). XGBoost captures complex non-linear interactions; LightGBM handles high-cardinality categorical features (zone GeoHash, city, vehicle type) faster and more accurately.

| Feature | Type | Source | Encodes |
|---|---|---|---|
| City / Zone GeoHash | Categorical | Registration | Sub-km flood/AQI/heat risk from NDMA/IMD data |
| Month (sin/cos encoded) | 2 floats | System clock | Seasonal peaks — monsoon July, AQI November |
| Historical AQI events (12-month) | Integer | CPCB historical | AQI>300 days in this exact zone last year |
| Historical rain events (12-month) | Integer | OpenWeatherMap historical | 35mm+ rainfall days in this zone last year |
| Disruption history (90-day) | Integer | Internal events log | Recent trigger frequency in the zone |
| Vehicle type | Categorical (3) | Registration | Bicycle = maximum AQI/heat exposure |
| Declared daily trips | Integer | Registration | Daily income at risk per disruption event |
| Average daily earnings | Float | Registration | Income baseline for actuarial loss calculation |
| Monthly work days | Integer | Registration | Exposure days per month |
| Coverage tier | Ordinal (1/2/3) | Policy selection | Basic/Standard/Premium output scaling |

**Output:** Single float — recommended weekly premium in rupees — plus `shap_breakdown` dictionary showing contribution of each feature.

**Phase 2 — LIVE ✅:** Full XGBoost + LightGBM ensemble loaded from `.pkl` files. Served at `POST /api/v1/premium/calculate` on the ML Service (port 8006). SHAP values computed per prediction. Response includes `shap_breakdown` with per-feature contribution in rupees.

**Phase 3 — IN PROGRESS 🔄:** Additional synthetic training data generation. SHAP waterfall chart UI in admin dashboard. LSTM disruption probability fed as an additional feature input.

---

### AI Component 2: Hybrid Fraud Detection Engine

**Problem it solves:** The Market Crash (Section 5) proved a parametric system without pre-payout fraud detection is a liquidity-draining attack surface. The engine must complete in under 60 seconds before any payout is authorized.

**Phase 2 — LIVE ✅:** Hybrid engine combining rule-based deterministic scoring (Layers 1–5) with ML ensemble inference.

```python
fraud_score = (
    0.30 * gps_physics_score     # 0.0 = clean satellite variance → 1.0 = spoofed
  + 0.25 * device_sensor_score   # 0.0 = cycling RMS → 1.0 = stationary
  + 0.25 * network_geo_score     # 0.0 = IP/GPS aligned → 1.0 = 4km+ mismatch
  + 0.20 * behavioral_score      # 0.0 = T-30 resident → 1.0 = burst/clique member
)
# Score → feature vector → Isolation Forest (anomaly) + GradientBoosting (classifier)
```

**Models loaded (Phase 2 production):**

| Model | Algorithm | Role | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `xgb_premium.pkl` | XGBoost | Premium pricing primary | ✅ Live |
| `lgbm_premium.pkl` | LightGBM | Premium pricing meta-learner | ✅ Live |
| `iso_forest_gps.pkl` | Isolation Forest | GPS anomaly detection | ✅ Live |
| `iso_forest_sensor.pkl` | Isolation Forest | Device sensor anomaly | ✅ Live |
| `iso_forest_network.pkl` | Isolation Forest | Network geo anomaly | ✅ Live |
| `iso_forest_behavioral.pkl` | Isolation Forest | Behavioral pattern anomaly | ✅ Live |
| `gb_fraud.pkl` | GradientBoosting | Fraud binary classifier | ✅ Live |
| `lstm_aqi.pkl` | PyTorch LSTM | AQI disruption forecast | ✅ Live |
| `lstm_rain.pkl` | PyTorch LSTM | Rainfall disruption forecast | ✅ Live |
| `lstm_heat.pkl` | PyTorch LSTM | Heatwave disruption forecast | ✅ Live |
| `scaler_fraud.pkl` | StandardScaler | Feature normalization | ✅ Live |

**Engineering note:** Achieving all 11 models loaded required resolving a `BitGenerator MT19937` pickle compatibility issue between scikit-learn versions, upgrading to `numpy>=2.0.0` and `pandas>=2.2.2`, and injecting `libgomp1` into the Docker image for LightGBM thread support. These are documented in the Dockerfile as explicit build steps — judges can verify in `services/ml_service/Dockerfile`.

---

### AI Component 3: Disruption Prediction LSTM

**Problem it solves:** If tomorrow shows 78% probability of Tier-2 AQI breach in Rohini, KavachAI pre-adjusts premiums, pre-funds reserves, and alerts admins before the event fires.

**Algorithm:** PyTorch LSTM — appropriate for sequential time-series where the current state depends on the previous N days.

**Input:** 15-day rolling window per zone: daily max AQI (CPCB), daily max temperature and rainfall (OpenWeatherMap), historical trigger event flag (binary).

**Output:** `P(disruption_event_next_7_days)` per zone — float 0.0–1.0. Three separate LSTM models cover AQI, rainfall, and heatwave forecasts.

**Phase 2 — LIVE ✅:** All three LSTM models loaded and serving via ML Service. Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/ml/predict/{zone_code}`. Used by the Trigger Engine for adaptive threshold tuning.

**Phase 3 — IN PROGRESS 🔄:** Admin dashboard visualization of 7-day probability curves per zone. NetworkX graph-based clique detection for coordinated fraud rings.

---

## 5. 🚨 Market Crash — Adversarial Defense & Anti-Spoofing Strategy

> **Crisis (March 19–20, 2026):** A syndicate of 500 delivery workers organized via Telegram to exploit a competitor's parametric insurance platform. Using free GPS spoofing apps (Fake GPS, GPS JoyStick, Floater), they broadcast fake coordinates inside active AQI disruption zones while sitting at home. The disruption was genuine — AQI 480 in Delhi. The competitor's single GPS zone check passed. The liquidity pool was drained. **Simple GPS verification is dead.**

### Why naive systems fail

A system checking only "Is this worker's GPS inside the affected zone?" has one boolean decision point. A mock GPS app defeats it in under 30 seconds with no hardware. The event is real. The policy is active. The zone matches. The only lie is the coordinate.

### KavachAI's response: Five independent signal layers

No single layer is the defense. All five must be simultaneously defeated — requiring hardware that costs more than any parametric payout.

---

#### Layer 5 (runs first): Zero-Trust Liveness Lock — "The Bouncer" ✅ Phase 2

**Deterministic. Cannot be ML-gamed. Runs before any scoring.**

The React Native app captures a live, geo-stamped, compressed selfie via `GPSCamera`. The FastAPI backend enforces three hard gates in sequence:

- **Biometric Time Lock:** Claim must arrive within 5 minutes of the trigger event. Syndicate members who see the Telegram alert 10 minutes later are rejected before any ML runs.
- **PostGIS `ST_Within` zone check:** Hardware GPS must be inside the rider's `primary_zone_id` polygon — not the city, the exact 2km zone.
- **Automated zone assignment:** `primary_zone_id` set via `ST_ClusterKMeans` on historical foreground GPS pings. Static geofencing is eliminated as a vulnerability.

**Bouncer fails → HTTP 403. Zero ML. Zero payout. Audit log entry created.**

---

#### Layer 1: GPS Physics Verification ✅ Phase 2

| Signal | Genuine Rider | GPS Spoofer | Detection |
|---|---|---|---|
| Satellite variance (σ) | ±2–8m ping-to-ping | Zero — physically impossible | σ < 0.5m across 5 pings → flag |
| Accuracy radius | 5–25m from HDOP | 0–1m injected, unrealistically perfect | `Location.accuracy` in React Native |
| GPS lock acquisition | 15–45 sec cold start | Instant — no satellite search | `gps_activated_at` → `first_fix_at` delta |
| Coordinate path | Follows OSM road geometry | Teleports or stays stationary "moving" | PostGIS road-snapping cross-reference |

---

#### Layer 2: Device Sensor Cross-Correlation ✅ Phase 2

A Q-Commerce cyclist produces **0.8–2.4 m/s² RMS** accelerometer signal. A stationary home rider produces **0.0–0.3 m/s² RMS**. The difference is ~8×. No app can fake accelerometer data on Android without root access.

**Gyroscope yaw correlation:** Real navigation produces yaw rate changes at intersections correlated with GPS heading. A spoofed GPS path cannot generate matching gyroscope turns on a stationary device. Heading-yaw mismatch > 15° at intersection nodes → fraud signal.

**Mock Location API hard stop:** `Settings.Secure.ALLOW_MOCK_LOCATION` checked at every claim initiation. Mock GPS enabled → claim held instantly, no score computed.

---

#### Layer 3: Network Geolocation Cross-Check ✅ Phase 2

A device's carrier IP is physically independent of the GPS module. KavachAI resolves the carrier IP to a coordinate at claim time and cross-references against the claimed GPS:

- Delta < 2km → clean
- Delta 2–4km → elevated; flagged for monitoring
- Delta > 4km → `Network_score += 0.8`

Cell tower handoff pattern: a legitimate moving rider shows 2–5 handoffs per 30 minutes. Stationary riders show zero. Zero handoffs + GPS showing movement = physical contradiction.

---

#### Layer 4: Behavioral & Temporal Pattern Analysis ✅ Phase 2

**T−30 residency check:** GPS pings required every 5 minutes during active coverage. A legitimate rider was in the zone before the trigger fired. A syndicate member opening the app after a Telegram alert is a sudden appearance — caught immediately.

**Coordinated burst detection:** Organic submissions follow Poisson distribution. When 150+ riders in one zone submit within a 90-second window, Redpanda's stream consumer quarantines the entire batch for review.

**NetworkX graph clique detection — Phase 3 🔄:** Riders, device fingerprints, and claims form graph nodes. A 500-person fraud ring forms a dense clique detectable via Louvain community detection in seconds.

---

### Graduated Response — Honest Workers Are Never Punished

| Score | Classification | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00–0.30 | ✅ Clean | Full payout. Auto-approved. Within 5 minutes. No worker action. |
| 0.30–0.50 | ⚠️ Low risk | Full payout, auto-approved. Enhanced logging. |
| 0.50–0.65 | 🔶 Elevated | Full payout, auto-approved. 48-hour retrospective audit flag. |
| 0.65–0.85 | 🔴 High risk | 50% immediately. 50% held for 2-hour review. Auto-released if signals resolve. Worker sees: *"₹175 credited now. ₹175 under verification — confirmed within 2 hours."* |
| 0.85–1.00 | 🚫 Critical | Full block. Admin review. Account flagged. |

**Network Drop Grace Period:** If GPS pings stop during an active disruption AND the last ping was inside the claim zone, the fraud score is held constant for 45 minutes. A cyclist whose phone drops in a flooded zone is never penalized for the exact condition being insured against.

---

## 7. System Architecture — After Market Crash

> The hardened architecture inserts a **5-layer adversarial defense engine** and **11 ML models** between the event stream and the payment service. The Bouncer (Layer 5) runs first — deterministic, no ML. The Detective (Layers 1–4 + ML Ensemble) runs second. No payout moves until both approve.

**Critical engineering fixes applied in Phase 2:**

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix Applied |
|---|---|---|
| `gb_fraud.pkl` failed to load | `BitGenerator MT19937` incompatibility between scikit-learn pickle version and runtime numpy | Upgraded to `numpy>=2.0.0`, `pandas>=2.2.2` across ML + Claims services |
| LightGBM refused to initialize | Missing `libgomp1` shared library in Docker image | Injected `libgomp1` as explicit Docker build step in `ml_service/Dockerfile` |
| `/api/v1/payments/summary` returned 404 | FastAPI dynamic `/{payment_id}` catch-all was intercepting the static `/summary` route | Fixed route topological ordering: static routes declared before dynamic ones |
| Payment summary query crashed | `policy_status` ENUM compared against VARCHAR string in raw SQL | Remapped SQLAlchemy `Policy.status` to strict PostgreSQL `Enum` type |

**Verified demo anchor — 25/25 audit pass:**

## 9. 🚀 How to Run — Judges Evaluation Guide

> **No cloud sprawl.** The entire architecture runs locally. No AWS/GCP IAM roles. No billing surprises. 100% free external APIs — OpenWeatherMap, CPCB India (government, no rate limit), NDMA RSS. Everything below executes on your machine.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required
Docker Desktop >= 24.0        → docker.com/products/docker-desktop
Python 3.11+                  → python.org (for simulation scripts only)
Git                           → git-scm.com

# Docker Desktop RAM allocation — important for 11 ML models
# Mac/Windows: Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → set 6GB RAM, 4 CPU cores

# Verify
docker --version && python3 --version
```

### Step 1 — Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhruvvv-26/KavachAI.git
cd KavachAI
cp .env.example .env
```

To securely evaluate the platform with our active API limits and production accounts, please download the required `.env` files from this **[Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11GOPV4GXGVU-OUgfGVSNTWUiPq_8c8MS?usp=drive_link)** instead of using the `.example` files.

> 🔐 **How to apply the Judge Secrets:**
> 1. Download `backend_env_secrets.txt` and rename it to `.env` in the root folder (i.e. `KavachAI/.env`).
> 2. Download `worker_app_env_secrets.txt` and rename it to `.env` inside the frontend folder (i.e. `KavachAI/worker-app/.env`).

> 📱 **Running the React Native Worker App (Physical Device)**
> If you want to evaluate the full end-to-end mobile experience (Expo, background sensor payloads, Firebase notifications), please follow our dedicated **[Worker App Demo Guide](WORKER_APP_DEMO.md)**. It walks you through matching your LAN IPs and running the `worker-app` natively so that you can follow along with simulated payouts on your own phone.

### Step 2 — Build and Start the Stack

```bash
# Build all 12 containers and start (first run: 3–5 minutes for ML image download)
docker compose up -d --build
```

> The ML Service image downloads PyTorch, XGBoost, and LightGBM binaries — this takes 2–4 minutes on the first build. Subsequent starts are under 30 seconds.

### Step 3 — Verify All Services Healthy

Wait **45–60 seconds** after startup for internal boot sequences to complete, then:

```bash
# Check all 6 FastAPI services
for port in 8001 8002 8003 8004 8005 8006; do curl -sf http://localhost:$port/health; echo ""; done
```

**Expected output:**
You are looking for every service to return `"status": "healthy"`. 
*(Particularly, check that `ml-service` on port `8006` reports `"models_loaded": 11`)*

---

### Step 4 — Accessing the Observability GUIs

Before running transactions, you can visually inspect the infrastructure:
*   **Redpanda Console (Message Broker GUI):** `http://localhost:8080`
    *   *Verify the topics exist:* `raw.trigger.events`, `processed.trigger.events`, `claims.approved`
*   **Grafana (Metrics Dashboard):** `http://localhost:3001`
    *   *Login:* `admin` / `admin` (skip password reset)

---

### Step 5 — The Phase 2 Evaluation Flow (API Testing)

You don't need a UI to verify massive backend processing! You can execute these test sequences from your terminal to watch the microservices communicate asynchronously.

#### Pre-Requisite: Seeding Test Data
Before simulating triggers, we must register a "test rider" and bind them to an active policy using our God Mode script.
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install requests psycopg2-binary
python3 scripts/god_mode_demo.py seed
```

#### Scenario A: Rider Premium Generation (ML Engine)
Test our XGBoost/LightGBM active pricing engine. KavachAI prices risk dynamically using geographic and weather datasets.
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8006/api/v1/premium/calculate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "city":"delhi_ncr",
    "vehicle_type":"bicycle",
    "coverage_tier":"standard",
    "month":7,
    "historical_aqi_events_12m":45,
    "historical_rain_events_12m":28,
    "disruption_history_90d":15,
    "declared_daily_trips":30,
    "avg_daily_earnings":1100.0,
    "monthly_work_days":22
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```
**👀 What to notice:** Look at the `shap_breakdown` in the JSON response. The engine isn't hardcoding premiums; it's weighing variables mathematically.

#### Scenario B: The "Happy Path" Payout (Zero-Touch Validation)
Let's simulate the `trigger-engine` detecting terrible Air Quality (AQI) in Delhi.
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/v1/trigger/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "zone_code":"delhi_rohini",
    "event_type":"aqi",
    "metric_value":450,
    "scenario":"clean"
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```
**👀 What to notice:** 
1. This hits Redpanda. The `claims-service` consumes it, verifies the simulated GPS coordinates against PostGIS, approves it, and pushes it back to Redpanda. 
2. The `payment-service` consumes the approval, simulates a Razorpay transaction, and pushes a receipt to Redis. 
*Verify the final payout notification landed in Redis:*
```bash
docker exec redis redis-cli -a redis_secure_2026 --raw LRANGE notifications:all 0 1 2>/dev/null | python3 -m json.tool
```

#### Scenario C: The "Hostile Path" (Geofence Fraud Defense)
Let's simulate a bad actor attempting to spoof their GPS to claim an AQI payout happening in Delhi, using a Mock Location app and zero physical movement.
```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8003/api/v1/trigger/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "zone_code":"delhi_rohini",
    "event_type":"aqi",
    "metric_value":500,
    "scenario":"spoofed"
  }' | python3 -m json.tool
```
**👀 What to notice:** 
Look at the local logs for the claims service:
```bash
docker logs claims-service | tail -n 20
```
You will see the Layer 5 Zero-Trust engine immediately hard-block the claim. The ML engine detects multiple contradictory data points like `fraud_flags: ["MOCK_LOCATION_DETECTED", "GPS_INSTANT_LOCK_228ms"]` because the defense engine exposes the fake telemetry.

#### Scenario D: The Actuarial Financial Dashboard
Verify the loss-ratio logic processing the transactions you just generated:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8005/api/v1/payments/summary | python3 -m json.tool
```
**👀 What to notice:** We calculate live metrics tracking `$ total_premiums` against `$ total_payouts` ensuring the platform remains mathematically solvent over time.

### Step 6 — Teardown

```bash
# Cleanly wipe all containers and volumes — no dangling data
docker compose down -v
```

---

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Container shows `Restarting` | Missing `.env` variable or port conflict | `docker logs <service> --tail 30` |
| ML Service shows `models_loaded < 11` | LSTM deserialization still in progress | Wait 30 more seconds; models load after FastAPI startup |
| `/health` returns connection refused | Service not yet started | Wait 60s after `docker compose up`, then retry |
| Redis `NOAUTH` error | Password mismatch | Confirm `REDIS_URL` in `.env` uses `redis_secure_2026` |
| FCM not sending push | Push token not registered | Set `FCM_DISPATCH_ENABLED=false` in `.env` — payout pipeline still works |
| `No claims found` after trigger | Claims service not consuming Redpanda | Verify inter-service URLs use container names, not `localhost` |
| Port already in use | Local service conflict | `lsof -i :8001` (Mac/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :8001` (Windows) |

---

## 10. ⚡ 60-Second Demo Script

### Automated (recommended)

```bash
# Install required dependencies
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install requests psycopg2-binary

# Seeds data + runs all 3 scenarios + prints pass/fail for each
python3 scripts/demo_script.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ CHECK 1 PASSED — Clean claim auto-approved in 4.2s
✅ CHECK 2 PASSED — Suspicious claim soft-held, partial payout in 5.1s
✅ CHECK 3 PASSED — GPS spoofing detected and blocked in 3.8s
🎯 KavachAI Demo: All checks passed in 13.1s
```

T+60s  Done. ML pricing, parametric trigger, fraud defense, actuarial viability — all demonstrated.
```

### Narration guide for each checkpoint

**Before Check 1 (Clean Claim):**
> *"Arjun is a Blinkit cyclist in Rohini, Delhi. AQI just crossed 450. Watch what happens — he does nothing."*

**After Check 1:**
> *"₹350 credited in under 5 seconds. No claim filed. No document uploaded. No phone call. The system detected the threshold, verified his signals were clean across five independent layers, and paid him automatically."*

**Before Check 2 (Suspicious — graduated response):**
> *"Now a suspicious rider. GPS is in the zone, but signal variance is too low and he only appeared after the Telegram alert went out."*

**After Check 2:**
> *"The system doesn't block him outright — it can't be certain. So it pays 50% immediately and holds 50% for 2-hour verification. Legitimate riders are never fully blocked. Fraud rings can't drain the pool."*

**Before Check 3 (Spoofed — blocked):**
> *"Now — the Market Crash scenario. Mock GPS app, sitting at home, accelerometer shows zero vibration, IP is 12km from the claimed zone."*

**After Check 3:**
> *"Blocked instantly. Five independent signal layers all contradict each other. This is what defeated the 500-rider Telegram syndicate. A single GPS coordinate check couldn't catch this. We built five."*

## 11. Parametric Trigger Design

Five triggers. All using free government and weather APIs. All with verified headroom for demo and production scale.

| Trigger | Data Source | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Payouts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heavy Rainfall | OpenWeatherMap | >35mm/24hr, 2hr | >65mm/24hr | >100mm/24hr | ₹200 / ₹380 / ₹600 |
| Hazardous AQI | CPCB India API | AQI>300, 4hr | AQI>400, 3hr | AQI>500 / GRAP IV | ₹150 / ₹300 / ₹500 |
| Extreme Heat | OpenWeatherMap | >43°C, 3hr | >45°C, 2hr | >47°C / IMD Severe | ₹150 / ₹250 / ₹450 |
| Cyclone / Storm | OpenWeatherMap | >55km/h + Yellow | >80km/h + Orange | >110km/h + Red | ₹250 / ₹450 / ₹750 |
| City Curfew / Bandh | NDMA & IMD RSS Feeds | Partial <12hr | Full 12–24hr | >24hr / state bandh | ₹200 / ₹400 / ₹700 |

### API Headroom

| API | Limit | KavachAI Usage | Buffer |
|---|---|---|---|
| OpenWeatherMap | 1,000 calls/day (free) | ~96/day (15-min × 6 cities) | 10× |
| CPCB India API | No rate limit (govt) | ~144/day | Unlimited |
| WeatherAPI.com | 1M calls/month (free) | ~288/day | Unlimited |
| NDMA + IMD RSS | No rate limit (govt) | ~288/day | Unlimited |

> **Hackathon Note on Curfew/RSS Triggers:** Our `Trigger Engine` actively polls live NDMA and IMD public RSS feeds every 5 minutes using `feedparser`. However, because we cannot guarantee a live disaster or city bandh during the judging period, these events are safely simulated using our `god_mode_demo.py` script to demonstrate the downstream ML fraud evaluation and payout execution logic.

## 12. Weekly Premium Model

```
Weekly Premium = Base Rate × Zone Risk × Seasonality × Platform × Coverage Tier
```

| City | Multiplier | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Delhi NCR | 2.6× | 41 AQI>300 days/yr + 28 heatwave days (CPCB/IMD 2024) |
| Mumbai | 2.4× | 23 heavy-rain days + 2 cyclone alerts (IMD 2024) |
| Kolkata | 2.1× | 18 cyclone-proximity days + 19 flooding events |
| Hyderabad | 1.9× | 31 heatwave days (IMD Telangana 2024) |
| Pune | 1.7× | 21 heavy-rain days (IMD Pune 2024) |
| Bengaluru | 1.4× | 14 waterlogging events (BBMP 2024) |

**Verified examples:**

```
Arjun — Blinkit cyclist, Rohini Delhi, Standard tier, April:
₹25 (base) × 2.6 (Delhi NCR) × 1.1 (Blinkit) × 1.2 (Standard) ≈ ₹67.60/week
Confirmed match with React Native app display ✅

Priya — Blinkit e-bike, Andheri Mumbai, Basic, December:
₹25 × 2.4 × 1.1 × 1.0 = ₹66/week (Basic cap → ₹60/week)

Ravi — Zepto cyclist, Koramangala Bengaluru, Standard, normal:
₹25 × 1.4 × 1.1 × 1.4 × 0.95 ≈ ₹51/week
```

**Loss ratio viability:**

```
1,000 Delhi NCR riders × ₹130/week avg premium = ₹1,30,000/week
Expected payouts at 65% loss ratio             = ₹84,500/week
Operating margin                               = ₹45,500/week
```

Viable from 1,000 riders. Real-time loss ratio tracking at `GET /api/v1/payments/summary`.

- [x] **Who is our user, really?** — Section 1: Arjun's specific profile, daily economics, binary income loss dynamic, market size with sources
- [x] **How does our AI actually work?** — Section 4: Algorithm rationale, exact feature tables, all 11 models named and described, honest Phase 2 vs Phase 3 per component
- [x] **How does it actually get built?** — Section 8: Week-by-week with acceptance criteria and ✅/🔄 status; Section 9: complete runnable evaluation guide with scenario commands

**Phase 2 technical evidence:**

- [x] 12 Docker containers — `docker compose up -d --build` starts full stack
- [x] 6 FastAPI microservices — OpenAPI docs at `/docs` on every service
- [x] 11 ML models loaded — `"models_loaded": 11` verified in ML Service `/health`
- [x] 3 Redpanda topics — `raw.trigger.events`, `processed.trigger.events`, `claims.approved`
- [x] Real event-driven pipeline — OpenWeatherMap/CPCB → APScheduler → Redpanda → Claims → Razorpay → FCM; end-to-end under 30 minutes
- [x] 5-layer anti-spoofing engine — Bouncer (deterministic, runs first) + Detective (4 layers + hybrid ML); verified in Section 9 Scenario C
- [x] Razorpay simulation with idempotency — verifiable at `GET /api/v1/payments/worker/{worker_id}`
- [x] Actuarial loss ratio API — `GET /api/v1/payments/summary` returns live metrics
- [x] Firebase FCM push notifications — `FCM_DISPATCH_ENABLED=false` fallback documented
- [x] Critical engineering fixes documented — numpy/libgomp1 ML deserialization, FastAPI route ordering, PostgreSQL ENUM type casting
- [x] Automated demo scripts — `demo_script.py` (3-check auto-runner) + `god_mode_demo.py --scenario` flag
- [x] Verified demo anchor record — worker_id and policy_id documented; 25/25 audit pass

**Honest Phase 3 framing:**

- [x] Phase 3 items marked 🔄 with specific target criteria — not claimed complete
- [x] Phase 2 uses same API contracts that Phase 3 will extend — no pipeline changes required to upgrade
- [x] Admin dashboard scaffolded — components listed in file structure, marked Phase 3

**Submission artifacts:**

- [x] HTML working prototype — `Prototype/KavachAI_Prototype.html`
- [x] Before Market Crash architecture — Section 6
- [x] After Market Crash architecture — Section 7: 12-container, 11-model, 5-layer system with correct APIs (OpenWeatherMap, CPCB India, NDMA, Firebase FCM)
- [x] YouTube demo video linked
